# Odroid N2+ Kodi Build Environment

## Why and What is this Repo
The Odroid Single Board Computers are great little machines.  And they get great initial support from the supplier (Android images, Ubuntu images, LibreElec images, and sometimes Arch and simple bootloaders), but there seems to be a lack of longevity support which is supposed to come from the community.

This repository is a single step forward on a thousand mile journey.  This repository's existence is to be able to provide automation and instructions to fully install and satisfy all build dependencies for compiling kodi on the Odroid N2+ running the Ubuntu Minimal image.  It is my hope that others will use this repository to help to create a better packaging and publishing of the kodi binaries for the ArmV8 (aarch64 arm64 cortex-a73.cortex-a53) architecture, and give owners of the Odroid N2(+) more ways to run their programs in the way that they want.

Don't get me wrong, I like LibreElec's approach to a minimalist installation to run kodi -- on lesser powerful SBCs.  But with the ARM CPUs that we have now, I like the idea of being able to SSH in and automate little things that my N2+ can take care of, while providing a kodi frontend as well.
